This is a little something I put together because I wanted to be able to get hold of my gamerscore for use in forum sigs, but didn't have access to the XBox Live API.

There are two parts to it: the gamercard parsing library (now in a separate subproject) and the sig image builder I wrapped around it.

The signature generator should be installed in a directory called "gamercard" in your web server.

It is built to be modular so you can create a new sig simply by creating a new
includable php file. So, if you're me (BSLSimes) and you want to create a new sig called "awesome", you create a file named awesome_sig.php. In this file you define a function named create_sig, which takes parameters $gamertag and $filetype, which will be the tag and image file extension from the requested URL. It should call getGamerCard() in the gamercard library to get the information for the requested tag, and return an image object representing the completed signature image.

The .htaccess file supplied rewrites all non-".php" URLs to point to index.php, which extracts from the URL path information about the sig type and the gamerscore. So, to continue our earlier example, we'd use the URL "http://myserver.com/gamercard/awesome/BSLSimes.jpg" to get a JPEG version of the "awesome" signature using my gamertag.

A couple of examples are included, the images are included so that the examples work but I'd prefer it if you didn't use them. One of them has my gamertag on it anyway so it would be a bit pointless. :)
