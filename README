This is a little something I put together because I wanted to be able to get hold of my gamerscore
for use in forum sigs, but didn't have access to the XBox Live API.

There are two parts to it: the gamercard parsing library (gamercard.php) and the sig image builder
I wrapped around it.

The parser library, given a gamertag, will grab the HTML gamercard from live.xbox.com and extract
the gamerscore and a few other salient details from it, returning a handy GamerCard object, which
is just a data container for the gamercard information.

The signature generator should be installed in a directory called "gamercard" in your web server.

It is built to be modular so you can create a new sig simply by creating a new
includable php file. So, if you're me (BSLSimes) and you want to create a new sig called "awesome",
you create a file named awesome_sig.php. In this file you define a function named create_sig, which
takes parameters $gamertag and $filetype, which will be the tag and image file extension from the 
requested URL. It should call getGamerCard() in the gamercard library to get the information for
the requested tag, and return an image object representing the completed signature image.

The .htaccess file supplied rewrites all non-".php" URLs to point to index.php, which extracts
from the URL path information about the sig type and the gamerscore. So, to continue our earlier
example, we'd use the URL "http://myserver.com/gamercard/awesome/BSLSimes.jpg" to get a JPEG
version of the "awesome" signature using my gamertag.

A couple of examples are included, the images are included so that the examples work but I'd prefer
it if you didn't use them. One of them has my gamertag on it anyway so it would be a bit pointless.
